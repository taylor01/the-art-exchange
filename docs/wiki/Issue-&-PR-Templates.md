# Issue & PR Templates

## Overview

The Art Exchange uses a structured approach to GitHub issues and pull requests to maintain project organization, clear communication, and efficient development workflow. This page documents our issue labeling system, templates, and process guidelines.

## GitHub Issue Structure

### Issue Labeling System

Based on analysis of the repository's issue management, we use a comprehensive labeling system:

#### Feature Labels (Required - One Per Issue)
- **`feature`** - New functionality or capabilities
- **`enhancement`** - Improvements to existing features
- **`bug`** - Bug fixes and error corrections
- **`security`** - Security-related work and improvements

#### Phase Labels (Development Timeline)
- **`phase-1`** - Foundation (authentication, core models, collections)
- **`phase-2`** - Social features (showcases, discovery, enhanced search)
- **`phase-3`** - Marketplace (sales, transactions, AI valuations)

#### Type Labels (Work Scope)
- **`backend`** - Server-side work (models, controllers, services)
- **`frontend`** - UI/UX work (views, styling, JavaScript)
- **`database`** - Schema changes, migrations, data work

#### Priority Labels
- **`high`** - Critical issues blocking development or production
- **`medium`** - Important features for current development phase
- **`low`** - Nice-to-have features or minor improvements

### Label Usage Guidelines

Every issue should have:
- ‚úÖ **At least one feature label** (feature/enhancement/bug/security)
- ‚úÖ **Phase label** for development timeline organization
- ‚úÖ **Type labels** to identify scope of work (can have multiple)
- ‚úÖ **Priority level** based on importance and urgency

Example label combinations:
- `feature` + `phase-1` + `backend` + `high`
- `enhancement` + `phase-2` + `frontend` + `medium`
- `bug` + `phase-1` + `database` + `high`
