# Production Data Migration Plan

## Overview
Migration from existing Rails application at theartexch.com to new Rails 8 application with enhanced architecture and features.

## Data Statistics

### Database Scale
- **773 Artworks** → posters
- **250 Transactions** (external sales)
- **~750 Users** (estimated)
- **~500 User Collections** (estimated)

### Image Assets
- **968 Artwork images** (1.25 images per artwork average)
- **981 Transaction images** (3.9 images per sale average)
- **~2,000 total images** to migrate from S3
- All images managed through ActiveStorage in production

### Data Complexity
- ✅ **Manageable scale** - small dataset perfect for migration testing
- ✅ **Clean schema** - well-structured PostgreSQL database
- ✅ **ActiveStorage compatible** - existing ActiveStorage implementation
- ⚠️ **Transaction photos** - rich feature requiring new model design

## Schema Mapping

### Table Mappings
```
Production → New Application
artworks          → posters
user_artworks     → user_posters  
artists           → artists (same)
bands             → bands (same)
venues            → venues (same)
series            → series (same)
transactions      → external_sales (NEW MODEL)
portfolios        → (IGNORE - unused tagging feature)
```

### Key Field Mappings

#### Artworks → Posters
```ruby
{
  id: :id,
  name: :name,
  edition_size: :edition_size, # ✅ Already implemented in new app
  release_date: :release_date,
  original_price: :original_price, # Keep as integer (cents)
  band_id: :band_id,
  venue_id: :venue_id,
  note: :description,
  ticker: nil, # IGNORE - StockX-inspired ticker concept (MET-9531)
  original_carrierwave_images: nil # Legacy - ignore
}
```

#### User_Artworks → User_Posters
```ruby
{
  user_id: :user_id,
  artwork_id: :poster_id,
  purchased_on: :purchase_date,
  purchase_price: :purchase_price, # Keep as integer (cents)
  edition_number: :edition_number,
  condition: :condition,
  notes: :notes,
  edition_type: :edition_type # ADD to new model - see enum values
}
```

#### Transactions → External_Sales (NEW FEATURE)
```ruby
{
  artwork_id: :poster_id,
  amount: :sale_price, # Keep as integer (cents)
  transaction_type: :transaction_type, # "sale", "purchase", etc.
  verified: :verified, # Boolean verification status
  verified_at: :verified_at,
  verified_by: :verified_by, # Email/name of verifier
  edition_number: :edition_number,
  transaction_date: :sale_date,
  condition: :condition,
  note: :notes
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Data Migration (Week 1)
**Priority: High - Required for MVP**

1. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Extract production data
   pg_restore --data-only production_backup.dump
   
   # Run migration scripts
   rails migrate:import_core_data
   ```

2. **Data Processing Order**
   ```
   1. Users (authentication data)
   2. Venues (location data)  
   3. Artists (creator data)
   4. Bands (performer data)
   5. Series (collection data)
   6. Artworks → Posters (main content)
   7. User_Artworks → User_Posters (collections)
   ```

3. **Core Image Migration**
   - Migrate 968 artwork images to poster.image attachments
   - S3-to-S3 copy for speed and quality preservation
   - Update ActiveStorage blob records

### Phase 2: External Sales Feature (Week 2)
**Priority: Medium - Valuable feature enhancement**

1. **New Model Creation**
   ```ruby
   # app/models/external_sale.rb
   class ExternalSale < ApplicationRecord
     belongs_to :poster
     has_many_attached :photos # Multiple photos per sale
     
     enum transaction_type: {
       sale: 'sale',
       purchase: 'purchase', 
       trade: 'trade'
     }
     
     validates :sale_price, presence: true, numericality: { greater_than: 0 }
     validates :sale_date, presence: true
   end
   ```

2. **Transaction Photo Migration**
   - Migrate 981 transaction images as sale documentation
   - Multiple photos per sale (avg 3.9 photos per transaction)
   - Use cases: listing photos, condition documentation, sold confirmations

3. **Admin Interface Enhancement**
   - External sales management
   - Photo upload and verification workflow
   - Sales analytics and reporting

### Phase 3: Data Validation & Cleanup (Week 3)
**Priority: High - Quality assurance**

1. **Data Integrity Checks**
   ```ruby
   # Verify record counts match
   validate_migration_counts
   
   # Check foreign key relationships
   validate_associations
   
   # Verify image attachments
   validate_image_migrations
   ```

2. **Image Quality Validation**
   - Verify all images accessible
   - Check file sizes and formats
   - Test image serving performance

3. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Collection functionality
   - Image display and upload
   - Search and browsing

## Technical Implementation

### Migration Scripts Structure
```
lib/tasks/production_migration.rake
├── migrate:analyze_production     # Data analysis and reporting
├── migrate:import_core_data       # Phase 1: Core migration
├── migrate:import_sales_data      # Phase 2: External sales
├── migrate:migrate_images         # Image migration with batching
├── migrate:validate_migration     # Data validation and verification
└── migrate:cleanup_temp_data      # Remove temporary migration data
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Batch processing** for large datasets (1000 records per batch)
- **Background jobs** for image migrations (Sidekiq)
- **Progress tracking** and resumable migrations
- **Transaction safety** with rollback capability

### Data Transformation Requirements

#### Price Handling
```ruby
# Store prices as integers (cents) for mathematical accuracy
# Production data likely already in cents
def normalize_price(price_value)
  case price_value
  when String
    (price_value.to_f * 100).to_i # Convert dollars to cents
  when Integer
    price_value # Already in cents
  else
    nil
  end
end
```

#### Edition Type Enum
```ruby
# Add to UserPoster model
enum edition_type: {
  "AE" => "AE - Artist Edition",
  "AP" => "AP - Artist Proof", 
  "MP" => "MP - Misprint",
  "OG" => "OG - Original Artwork",
  "SE" => "SE - Show Edition",
  "TS" => "TS - Test Print",
  "OT" => "OT - Other"
}
```

#### Date Handling
```ruby
# Ensure date formats are consistent
def normalize_date(date_value)
  return nil if date_value.blank?
  Date.parse(date_value.to_s)
rescue ArgumentError
  nil
end
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy
- **Full database backup** before migration
- **S3 bucket snapshot** of images
- **Rollback scripts** for each migration phase
- **Test environment validation** before production

### Migration Testing
1. **Subset testing** with 10-20 records
2. **Full staging migration** with complete dataset
3. **Performance testing** with production data volumes
4. **User acceptance testing** with real user workflows

- ✅ **ActiveStorage Integration**: 100% functional
- ✅ **Local Development Storage**: All images accessible

#### Phase 3: User Collections Migration
- ✅ **User Collections**: 374/375 migrated (99.7% success)
- ✅ **Collection Status**: All marked as 'owned' (original app design)
- ✅ **Edition Types**: Normalized from production format
- ✅ **Condition Values**: Normalized from production format

### Key Architectural Changes Made:

1. **Optional Band/Venue**: Updated Poster model to support both gig posters and original art
   - Made `band_id` and `venue_id` nullable in database
   - Updated all views to handle optional associations
   - Model now supports: `belongs_to :band, optional: true`

2. **Automatic Name Generation**: Created smart poster naming for blank names
   - Generates names like "Pearl Jam - Fox Theatre - 2023" for gig posters
   - Falls back to "Poster #ID" for minimal data
   - Handles missing release dates with current date default

3. **User Collections Status Logic**: Fixed to match original app design
   - All production collections marked as 'owned' (original app had no want lists)
   - Preserves original data model without introducing incorrect categorization

4. **Data Quality Handling**: 
   - URL normalization for artist/band websites (adds http:// prefix)
   - Price normalization (converts various formats to integer cents)
   - Condition normalization ("Near Mint" → "near_mint")
   - Edition type normalization ("SE - Show Edition" → "SE")
   - Geocoding disabled during venue migration for performance

### Database Schema Updates Applied:
- `20250625014649_make_band_and_venue_optional_on_posters.rb`
- `20250625020622_add_edition_type_to_user_posters.rb`
- Updated model validations and view conditionals
- All existing functionality preserved

### Migration Task Structure (Production Ready):
```bash
# Full migration sequence:
rake migrate:import_core_data     # Users, venues, artists, bands, series, posters
rake migrate:migrate_images       # Poster images via ActiveStorage
